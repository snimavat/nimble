**This is a fork of [snimavat/nimble](https://github.com/snimavat/nimble)**

Changes in this fork are:

* Added configuration for the administration layout header title. Use nimble.admin.header.title to set the header
* Do not expose the user id in activation emails. Set nimble.exposeUserId = false to remove id
* Added annotation [@NimbleAuth](https://github.com/rohitkumbhar/nimble/blob/master/src/groovy/grails/plugin/nimble/auth/NimbleAuth.groovy) to enforce authentication and optionally check for role and permission
